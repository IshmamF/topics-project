## Project Description
### Name: Knowledge Vault  
### Description:
In today's digital era, we consume vast amounts of information daily, yet most of it is quickly forgottenâ€”even the insights we find valuable.

Knowledge Vault is a Chrome extension and web application designed to help users capture, organize, and retain key information from articles, videos, and snippets. With AI-powered summarization, categorization, and tagging, users can efficiently store insights and attach personal notes.

On the web app, the saved content is transformed into mind maps, flashcards, and structured tables, enabling better recall through interactive formats.

### Primary Users: Students, lifelong learners, productivity enthusiasts
