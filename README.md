## Project Description
### Name: Knowledge Vault  
### Description:
> In this day and age, we are consuming so much digital content everyday and despite all the information, we're not retaining most of it - even the ones you found to be very helpful. <br/>
> What if you had a chrome extension that allowed you to save any snippet, article, video, or insight as well as attach any notes you might want to consider. Then have an AI summarize and <br/>
> categorize the media. Finally we can save this information, and on a web application display it there as mind maps, flash cards, and as a table. We can apply other learning techniques like <br/>
> space repetition to ensure better retention. 
### Primary Users: People who want to retail useful information after doom scrolling for hours
